like pomofocus.io but in Odin.

Build:
	# Odin has support for bindings to miniaudio library in its vendor collection
	# but they don't come prebuilt. Build them first by running:
	
	make -C "odin-linux-amd64-nightly+2025-10-05/vendor/miniaudio/src"

	# build the project itself (minimal CLI version)
	odin build src/cli/ -out:pomodin

	# or the GUI
	odin build src/gui/ -out:pomodin

Use:
	sudo cp ./pomodin /usr/local/bin/pomodin
	pomodin 30
