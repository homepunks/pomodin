like pomofocus.io but in Odin.

For the nearest time, you can specify the focus time (30 mins by default) before building.
Changing it would require a rebuild (change it by altering the default_timer in src/gui/pom.odin).
Breaktime preserves the pomodoro format (3 short breaks followed by one long), where, by default,
short is 5 mins and long is 15.

Build:
	# Odin has support for bindings to miniaudio library in its vendor collection
	# but they don't come prebuilt. Build them first by running:
	
	make -C "odin-linux-amd64-nightly+2025-10-05/vendor/miniaudio/src"

	# build the project itself (GUI)
	odin build src/gui/ -out:pomodin

	# or the minimal CLI version
	odin build src/cli/ -out:pomodin

Use:
	sudo cp ./pomodin /usr/local/bin/pomodin
	pomodin 30
